# Data munipulation

# In phython we have operators, that 
# allow us to change data.

# Assignment operators
# assignment opperators use some combination of the equal
# to give a variable a value.

name = 'James' # the equal sign is the opertor
willItsnow = True
numberOfSandwiches = 10
bankAccount = 10000

# Comparison operators
# comparisons operators allow us to evaluate data 
# based on several factors

10 < 20 # is 10 less than 20

20.34 >= 0 #is 20.34 greater than or equal to 0

100 = 100 # is 100 ethe SAME as 100

100 != 10 # is 100 NOT theSAME AS 10

# Arithmatic operators
# the arithmatic operators allow us to perform 
# math with- specifically with the integer and float
# data types

10 + 10 # addition
12 - 2 # subtraction
10 * 3 # multiplication
2 / 1 # division

# Logical operators
# we use logical operators to evaluate if data is true
# or false
