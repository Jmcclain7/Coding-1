In your own words, describe what a function is? A function is a type of code that shows wheather something is true or not.
Create a function that will take in a users data and then print the data out. Hint: you will need to use the input() function to accomplish this. Research the input() function on W3schools if you need a refresher on how it works.
def data():
    x = 20
    y = 30
    z = 10
    print(x + y + z)

    
You have been hired to create an affordability checker for a real estate company.

If they do have enough money, it should print out true, if they don not, it should print out false.

def money():
    House = 100,000
    Furniture = 150,000
    Room acessories = 50,000
    Food = 10,000
    Clothes,Shoes,School = 90,000
