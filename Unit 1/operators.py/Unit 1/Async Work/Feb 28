In your own words, describe what a function is? A function is a type of code that shows wheather something is true or not.
1 # A function is a container for code instructions. Functions run code instructions only when its called.
Create a function that will take in a users data and then print the data out. Hint: you will need to use the input() function to accomplish this. Research the input() function on W3schools if you need a refresher on how it works.
# step 1. create function definition
def message():
    response = input('please enter a message')
    print(response)

# step 2. "call" the function
message()
